**This is the Python 3 porting repo for [Ultros](https://github.com/UltrosBot/Ultros). We will be working on an
asyncio-based verison of Ultros here, and this will become the main repo once everything is done and ready.**

Please note that this is not a direct port, but a full rewrite. As a result, Ultros will be mechanically different.
We will provide instructions on moving from the old version to the new one in due course.
