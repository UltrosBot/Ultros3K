Design and rationale
====================

A lot of thought needs to go into the base mechanics and layout of this new
version of Ultros. As a result, we feel it's prudent to document our design
and why we decided on it.

.. warning::

    This section is likely to change as we make decisions about how Ultros
    should work, and when we correct any design faults. As such, this is not
    a final version.
